=== Google code ===
	* Multipurpose use
		* Sharing source code 
		* Wiki Dokumentation
		* Issue tracking (Can be used across the groups)
		* Inter-group communication
		* Projekt planning
	* SVN
		* Branching/dev - stable
		* Trunk
	* Worked very well (Accept the group which did not participate)

			
=== Meeting types ===
	* Group leader meetings (Was effective for decision making)
		* Definition of target group
		* FACTORS
		* System definition
		* Source code license
		* Code conventions
		* Prefix sw6.`*` for packages
		* Arrangement of workgroup meetings
	* Grand meetings (Everyone attending, to many topics and opinions)
	* Group to group meetings (ad-hoc, small and productive)
	* Workgroup meetings (One from each group, discuss specific technical issues - Worked well)
	

=== What to learn ===
	* No one may isolate themselves or stand alone
	* Commitment and involment are needed
	* Everyone must be prepared and active at the meetings, if not measures to ensure this must be taken
	* A multiprojekt group contract should be made considering the cooperation of the groups as a whole
	* Make "small" promises to meet the deadlines
	* Quality over quantity
	* You are not you're code
	* Use the same development method, and follow the same release cycle where possible
	* Everyone may have to make compromises, and it is a necessity
	* The target group must be agreed on (Age, abilities, ect.)
	* It would be beneficial to use a common architecture (For further development and understand) 
	* Discuss common features, there may be a overlap and cooperation may be possible
	* A deadline is a deadline and it must not be missed
	* Some general demands must be in place before the coding should begin, otherwise people may end up in different directions
