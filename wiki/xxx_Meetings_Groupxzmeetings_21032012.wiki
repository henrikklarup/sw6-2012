=== Launcher group (20 min) ===

Usability is important therefore a common gui would be nice, this would be nice to achive through a framework.

A dream would be an app which makes it possible to change settings by touching the screen instead of entering numbers.

Will make it possible to have apps or specifik code run before or after the choshen app.

Every app should make room for an overlay.

Usability is both for guardians and the children with autism.

Who makes the settings? The launcher group, every group makes it own or the admin group takes care of it.

=== Admin: "Database design and Library" (20 min) ===
	
The local and global database designs are located on the svn under random group stuff, admin and server respectively.

It is a possibility to have a server at every institution.

It is possible to have several children connected with one guardian.

Ulrik thinks the parents should be able to fully utilize the system.
	
=== News from the responsible people: ===

Send demands to Martin if he is supposed to get a overview on them.

Magnus thinks we should stand up when presenting what every group have made since the last meeting and what we will make till the next meeting.

What should be done about groups not present at meetings. When not able to come to a meeting a mail should be sent to the meeting coordinator.
Help each other in the groups, it will help all of us in the long run.
