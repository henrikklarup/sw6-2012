### Google code ###
  * Multipurpose use
    * Sharing source code
    * Wiki Dokumentation
    * Issue tracking (Can be used across the groups)
    * Inter-group communication
    * Projekt planning
  * SVN
    * Branching/dev - stable
    * Trunk
  * Worked very well (Accept the group which did not participate)


### Meeting types ###
  * Group leader meetings (Was effective for decision making)
    * Definition of target group
    * FACTORS
    * System definition
    * Source code license
    * Code conventions
    * Prefix sw6.`*` for packages
    * Arrangement of workgroup meetings
  * Grand meetings (Everyone attending, to many topics and opinions)
  * Group to group meetings (ad-hoc, small and productive)
  * Workgroup meetings (One from each group, discuss specific technical issues - Worked well)


### What to learn ###
  * No one may isolate themselves or stand alone
  * Commitment and involment are needed
  * Everyone must be prepared and active at the meetings, if not measures to ensure this must be taken
  * A multiprojekt group contract should be made considering the cooperation of the groups as a whole
  * Make "small" promises to meet the deadlines
  * Quality over quantity
  * You are not you're code
  * Use the same development method, and follow the same release cycle where possible
  * Everyone may have to make compromises, and it is a necessity
  * The target group must be agreed on (Age, abilities, ect.)
  * It would be beneficial to use a common architecture (For further development and understand)
  * Discuss common features, there may be a overlap and cooperation may be possible
  * A deadline is a deadline and it must not be missed
  * Some general demands must be in place before the coding should begin, otherwise people may end up in different directions
