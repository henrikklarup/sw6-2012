## Details ##

Who are the children that you are working with?:
  * From 2 to 6 years old
  * covers the whole spectrum, from normal to 84.0 autism and asperger
  * They arive with taxa
  * The parents have different resources so the educators does not tell the parents what they can do but focuses instead on helping the children while they are on the institution



The childrens' special needs:
  * Aspergers needs time scedules
  * children with autism don't know how to do simple tasks, they need visual support because they have limited fantasy. The educators works as their visual stimulation.
  * A simple task like washing hands consists of several smaller tasks that confuses the child if they have no scheme that shows these tasks
  * The children can learn to do tasks without the visual support but this can take long time and if the situation is slightly different (like washing hands in a new location) they might get stuck
  * Children with autism have a varying circadian
  * It makes a huge difference when the children is at the institution where they learn to connect pictures with real things
  * The childrens interests is very important and should be taken into account
  * If the children don't want to do something you cannot force them
  * If you tell a child with autism to wait they don't know for how long so they need a visual indicator like an hourglas, it is important that they know when it starts and when it stops.
  * The educators carry picture cards with activities. If the visual stimulation is not constantly present the child will forget what to do.
  * A simple task like taking on boots must be devided into smaller tasks, the number of tasks required varies from child to child and can also be different for the same child depending on its mood
  * The children will see a horizontal line of pictures differently than a vertical line of pictures.
  * Timespecific events is unimportant for children with autism. They don't need to know that lunch is at 12.00 but rather that lunch is after washing hands.



The goal of helping the children:
  * They should be self-reliant
  * They should be independand of the educators using their help systems



What tools are used now?:
  * Teacch, they take each child's special needs into account, this is in the form of steps or pictures
  * they are using concretes - an item that the child connects with a action
  * The parents sees schemes as too strict but the educators find them very flexible
  * time timer - visual time device
  * When on fieldtrips they bring lots of time devices
  * hourglas is a good time measurement tool because the children are used to it from the institution
  * Board maker - you can write different actions and a picture of that action will be selected. You can add details yourself like walk with a red bad if the child should carry a red bag.
  * each department have a touchscreen and a computer. They play games on them. They have no internet access. it happens that they do stuff they should not be able to do. The educators miss some kind of lock on the computers



Suggestions to our product:
  * It is not the parents that should be taken into account when developing our system
  * activities on a timeline that can help structure the childrens' day
  * When a timeline is done a new activity should be avaiable else the child would get stuck
  * Drag and drop could be used to drag activities from he timeline to a time taking application so you are able to see the time it would take to do that activity
  * maybe the tablets should be hung on the wall or encapsulated in glass to avoid damaging the device
  * The children could drop the tablet on the floor if provoked so maybe they should not be givin the tablet but keep it to the educators.
  * If we want to use the Board maker pictures we need aproval
  * They like the idea to have profiles for the children so you can adapt the pictures to what the child understand best
  * The educators can save time using our system but they reqire that it is very flexible
  * They suggest that we concentrate on a few children because it is almost impossible given the circumstances to develope a system for the whole usergroup
  * Is the tool for the children or the educators? Maybe the educators would have most use of the system
  * There should be sufficiant locking support so children would not do unwanted actions
  * There are different procedures for finished activities, some children needs to see what has been finished while others want the finised activities to disapear
  * There should be clear indication of where on a timeline you currently are
  * They request that we finish a little part of the system and make it work very good. Quality over quantity



Is it possible to visit the institution to get a better overview of the target group?:
  * It is possible to visit for an hour or two and follow how the educators handle the children.
