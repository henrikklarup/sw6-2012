\section{Authentication Activity}

This activity implements the design described in \autoref{design:authentication} and is the first activity the user will face when using the \giraf[] system. It is also the current lock screen which is used by WOMBAT \autoref{backlog:lock_screen}.

This activity was implemented using ZXing \citep{web:ZXing}, pronouced Zebra crossing, which is a libaray under Apache 2.0. This library is made for use with Android for scanning 1D and 2D QR codes. There have been made changes to the original ZXing library to make it fit into the implementation of this activity.

There is implemented instructions and illustrations as mentioned in \autoref{design:authentication}. There is also implemented a gesture, a 500ms vibration, for showing the user that the QR code was scanned correct because some of the users had trouble seeing the login button when it appeard.
