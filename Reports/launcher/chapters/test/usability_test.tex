\section{Usability Testing}
This section describes the usability testing that has been performed, and the results obtained. 

\subsection{Test Circumstances/Something}
\todo{Lav overskrift}
Only one usability test was performed, as the customers had provided continuous positive feedback on the product. 
As such, the test was also performed late in the project as a means of verifying that high usability had been achieved, rather than using the test to find problems that would then be fixed as the project came underway. \newline
The test was setup to test for both discoverability and usability. 
Discoverability was tested as the customers had mentioned the high costs associated with certified learning courses during interviews (see \autoref{interviews}) as a disadvantage of current systems, and making functionality easy to discover would help reduce the need for such courses.

\subsection{Test Setup}
The entire \giraf[] product was tested in the usability test, and all customers of the project attended as test subjects. 
The test was split into front end and back end testing; the three front end \localgroup[]s (launcher, WOMBAT and PARROT) had their apps tested, while the back end \localgroup[]s (Oasis and Savannah) had their respective administration tools tested. 
More details on the tests can be found in \autoref{usability_test}.
