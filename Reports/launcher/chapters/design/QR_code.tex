\section{QR code test}
To make a decision on how many characters the QR codes should hold it was needed to make a test. The test was done by making a timer on the device and see how long it would take to move the tablet from the table over the QR code to the authentication accepted. 
From what can be seen in the results it is not possible to make a comparison because it is such a small test size. But it can be concluded that there is no significant difference between using e.g. 10 and 200 characters. \\
The results from this test can be seen in \autoref{fig:QR-code-test}

\todo{should this be here?}
