\textbf{Duration:} Seven half days. \newline

The focus of this sprint was on usability. 
This includes creating use cases, evaluating login methods, and designing visual elements of the system. 
By the end of the sprint, a usable design had been created. 
Some of the use cases created can be seen in \autoref{appendix_use_cases}. \newline
Managementwise, the meetings held in the \globalgroup{} until this point had been marked by lengthy discussions and knowledge sharing, which made the meetings bloated and ineffecient. 
This improved by now, as most major decisions about the project had been made and knowledge sharing had been done for most relevant subjects. 
The meetings also improved as the organization of the \globalgroup{} improved, and better restrictions were put in place to help alleviate unnecessary discussion. \newline
There were issues with miscommunication however. 
For example, we presented ideas at a meeting in this sprint, but did not clearly communicate which parts we would aim to implement, and which we considered part of our vision for the system, but would not pursue.
