\chapter{Backlog}
\label{chap:backlog}

The features described and divided into two groups, \emph{implemented}, and \emph{unimplemented}.
The features listed in the \nameref{backlog_implemented} section got implemented in the launcher and were prioritized higher than those found in the \nameref{backlog_unimplemented} section. Features in the \nameref{backlog_implemented} section were not necesarily of low priority, but did not get implemented, as time did not allow it. \todo{skriv om hvor man kan laese om hvorfor de er prioritized som de er.}
