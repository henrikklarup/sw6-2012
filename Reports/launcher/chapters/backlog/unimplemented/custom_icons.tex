\subsection{Custom Icons}
\label{backlog:custom_icons}

This feature can change the icon of an app in the app grid. The reason it is important as a feature is seen in \autoref{Preanalysis:Usability_for_children}. Recognition is important for children and if they symbolize an app with another thing e.g. PARROT with a picture well known from their everyday it should be possible for them or their guardian to choose.
