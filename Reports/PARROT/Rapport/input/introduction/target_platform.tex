\section{Target Platform}
Since we build upon last year's project, we are bound to use the platform they used, which is tablets running the Android operating system.

In this project we have been provided with five Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 devices\cite{tablet}. The firmware on the tablets is version 3.2. This version, as of project start, is the latest stable version available for these specific tablets. \cite{AndroidVersion}
