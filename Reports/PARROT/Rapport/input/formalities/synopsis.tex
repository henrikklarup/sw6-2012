This is a sixth semester report for the AAU Department of Computer Science and is a part of a multi project with focus on making an android based application for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. The first part of the report is a common part, which presents the goal for the entire multi project on this semester. Next comes the analysis of our part of the multi project and following this comes the design for the  PARROT application, based on the analysis.
Then the implementation of the application is presented, where the functionality is described into details. 
Last a test chapter will be present what we have achieved in this semester, and conclude what worked and what did not work, in order to determine what to put in the future work section.

This report is also written as an aid for the next years sixth semester students to help them continue on the project.   



%This report is a fifth semester report for The AAU Department of Computer science, with a focus on Real Time system scheduability in an attempt to successfully build and program a working color sorter.
%The report contains a series of hardware tests, Real Time System Theory and Practical use, along with a description of the design and a working implementation of our Color sorter.


%%This report has been written at the 5th Semester of software at Aalborg University in the fall of 2011. The report is about Real Time Systems, and how such systems are working. A color sorting machine is constucted from LEGO bricks and is able to sort different the three colors red, green and blue into different bins. First by determining the color of the LEGO brick, and secondly by registering the brick at different points of the system, before pushing it off the conveyor belt at the right place. Task consideration has to be take into consideration, to be able to make it all work as intended. Two tasks are not allowed to execute at same time, which is ensured by using a a single core processor, which does not support multi threading. \\
