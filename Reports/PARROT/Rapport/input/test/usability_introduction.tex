\section{Introduction}
This chapter will document both our own testing phase as well as the usability test of PARROT, performed in collaboration with all groups in the GIRAF Multi-Project.
While the parts of the usability test has been introduced in the common report, the PARROT specific questions and results will be presented in this chapter.
The testing phase was performed in combination with the PE-course Test and Verification, so that the design was written early in the development of our system and the tests were performed after the development had been suspended.
Because of this, there are tests which cannot be performed due to a lack of functionality.
