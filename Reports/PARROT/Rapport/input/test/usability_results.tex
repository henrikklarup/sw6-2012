\section{Usability Test Results}
\label{sec:UseTestRes}
The test results are noted in Table \ref{tab:ErrorsFoundInUsabilityTest}, they are the product of a group assembled by the Multi-Project Group.
None of the member of the PARROT project participated in usability testing PARROT, so the severity of the errors are not defined by us, but by the persons running the test, as described in the IDA model.
