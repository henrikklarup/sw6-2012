\chapter{Implementation}
\label{imp}
\textit{In the this chapter parts of the software will be presented. The Source Code associated with the software will be presented and described as well. The software is based on the previously analyzed design and calculations. So far it has been described how the model is supposed to work, and now the software implementation will be described in detail.}

Some features of the PARRET App will be described first as the problem that spurred the feature and what solution we thought up. 
We will then describe our solution to the problem with code segments and what notes we might have to the feature before recommending what to read when exploring the problem further.\\

\textit{The software for the PARROT application was presented in this chapter and the Source Code for the features and the design has been described. Now that the application is in a working state and running, it is possible to make the tests of the Source Code.}
