\subsection{Reflections}
We did not outsource the test, so we did the testing ourselves. This is not the best way to do testing, because we wrote the program, and the test design and test cases, and thereby have a deeper knowledge about the features we want to test, and therefore we may have done things different than persons with no knowledge about the application would have done.

The only test that did not pass was known beforehand (\textit{checkLastUsed\#1}). We had trouble implementing the "Last Used" together with the features of the database developed by the admin-group. This resulted in sporadic system failure, so we decided to only use the tablet memory to save the last used timers, and save the correct implementation of this feature to future development.\\

During the test we stumbled upon a few vague formulations, which could have lead to misunderstandings and different testing method, if the tests had been outsourced. We learned that it is a good idea to run the test ourselves at first, so that we could correct any formulation errors we found, and then the test could be outsourced. This would require even more time, and is not likely to be done in large scale projects, but could have been done in our case.
