\section{Fragments}

In short is a fragment in Android functioning much like iFrames in html, meaning that a fragment is an embedded activity within another activity.
According to Google the design philosophy of fragments are that they support a more dynamic and versatile design of applications on devices with larger screens, such as tablets.
Google states that on these kind of devices there are more room to combine and interchange interface components, compared to a handset. 
An example of the use of multiple fragments on a large screen compared to activities on smaller handsets, is the Gmail application from Google:

This and more information about fragments can be found at \cite{web:android:fragments}.

\subsection{Benefits and Limitations}
%What is the benefits of a fragment compared to an activity
%Which Android versions support fragments
Fragments alone are not more powerful than activities and fragments can not exist without activities.
When combining multiple fragments in one activity, the fragments are able to create dynamic interfaces which does not require the entire activity to be reloaded when changing an object on the screen.\\

The Gmail application utilizes this by having an overview of the email account on the left side of the device while showing specific mail content on the right side as seen in figure \ref{fig:fragment_gmail}.

Fragments are built to be reused in multiple activities, which means that a single fragment can be used in several ways depending on the platform.
The main activity only has to declare which fragments it holds in the layout.

As of 3rd March 2011 Google has made the "`Android Compatibility Package"', a library which let Android 1.6 devices or newer support fragments aswell \cite{web:android:fragments:support}.
Mobile tuts+, a website with tutorials about Android development, has tested the "`Android Compatibility Package"' and confirms that it even works on the T-Mobile G1 (the first Android device) \cite{web:android:fragments:compatibility}.
