\textit{Through the development process we have used a variety of tools.
When designing we have made use of stories an prototypes to communicate our ideas to our contact person and the other project groups.
We made use of metaphors in our system design, to enhance the learnability of the system, by using symbols and design which may be recognized by the users.}\\

\textit{During the development we used pair programming and refactoring to ensure higher quality of the code, and thereby enhance the readability for the sake of the students of next year, who are probably going to continue the development.}\\

\textit{In the implementation of WOMBAT fragments and lists are essential for the main screen, lists because they hold the user data, and fragments because they ensure smooth and customizable user interface features.}\\

\textit{The testing has also been an essential part of the development of the WOMBAT system.
During the integration of all the different GIRAF system applications there has been a lot of undocumented testing, to get the applications to work together.}\\

\textit{Formal black-box test and acceptance test has proven that WOMBAT functions correctly, and is ready to be used in the institutions, but the usability test revealed a number of design issues, which could be corrected in the future.}
