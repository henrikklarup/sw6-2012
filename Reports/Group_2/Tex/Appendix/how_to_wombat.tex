\section{WOMBAT Setup for Eclipse}
To fetch the released code from SVN, make a checkout to \url{https://sw6-2012.googlecode.com/svn/tags/wombat/}, previous versions of the project, reports, and the wiki can be found by making a checkout to \url{https://sw6-2012.googlecode.com/svn/}.
The folders on SVN contains the following:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{trunk} - contains iteration releases of the code.
		\item \textit{branches} - contains code under development.
		\item \textit{tags} - contains the newest final release of the code.
		\item \textit{common\_report} - contains the common part of the report.
		\item \textit{Reports} - contains all group reports.
		\item \textit{wiki} - contains summaries from all group- and supervisor meetings, and guides/agreements.
	\end{itemize}
	
When SVN checkout has finished downloading content from the SVN, import Wombat, AmbilWarna (the color picker), and wheel projects from svn to Eclipse, figure \ref{fig:import1}.

	\label{fig:import1}
\end{figure}

Right click the Wombat project in Eclipse and click "Properties".\\
Under the "Android" pane, ensure that AmbilWarna and wheel are added as project libraries, figure \ref{fig:add_libs}.

	\label{fig:add_libs}
\end{figure}

In case Eclipse fails to recognize the libraries in the libs folder, manually add the three JAR files in Wombat/libs on svn as external JARs, in Wombat - Properties, figure \ref{fig:external_jar}.

	\caption{Add Oasis, \texttt{TimerLib}, and \texttt{DrawLib} as external JARs if Eclipse cant recognize them in the libs folder.}

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Extras}
To edit the \texttt{TimerLib} and \texttt{DrawLib} the two projects has to be imported to the workspace in Eclipse, figure \ref{fig:import2}.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Import TimerLib and DrawLib to the workspace.}
	\label{fig:import2}
\end{figure}

To debug the \texttt{TimerLib} and \texttt{DrawLib} in WOMBAT the projects has to be added as libraries in the Wombat properties, with AmbilWarna and wheel, figure \ref{fig:add_timer_draw_lib}.
Then the \texttt{TimerLib} and \texttt{DrawLib} JARs has to be deleted from the libs folder or the Java Build Path library, to avoid a compile error.
