This project is about the development of an Android timer application that will ease the daily routine for both children with autism spectrum disorder and their educators and parents. The educators and parents use physical timers to help the children manage their activities, these timers exists in a variety of forms, colors, and timespan. Furthermore the educators and parents can use pictograms to inform the children, of which activity is currently in progress or it can be used as a schedule to describe their daily routines. The timer application is developed with the goal to replace the physical timers by providing virtual timers. The timer application is developed such that the educators and parents can attach an extra timer or pictogram(s) next to the timer in progress.

This project is a part of the multi project system, GIRAF. Which is a system specifically developed to ease the daily routine for educators and parents by providing a collection of tools.
