\subsubsection{Initial Requirement gathering}
Requirement gathering was done in the multi project group in the very early stages of the project, but has also been updated as we have been progressing and showing our work to our customers.
In the initial stages we did semi-structured interviews of our customers, where the primary focus was understanding our target group and exploring any tools they currently have access to.
As mentioned the interviews were conducted in a semi-structured manner, we had a few questions%which..are missing?!?
but tried to let the interview run as an informal conversation where the customers could present their own ideas and visions of the project.

From these interviews we created an initial list of requirements for the multi project.
three interviews were done, with Mette and Christina from (ehhh) , Drazenko from (ehh), and Tove from Tale Instituttet(the speech center).
From the individual interviews we gathered a list of their individual ideas and visions and made a requirements list which groups later could refer back to.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mette And Christina 
  \subitem Customizable software
  \subitem Ease of use, compared to current physical tools
  \subitem Emphasize visual stimuli
  \subitem Continuous stimuli 
 \item Drazenko
  \subitem Customizable software
  \subitem Visual abstract concept
  \subitem Emphasize visual stimuli
  \subitem Unambiguous
  \subitem Consistency/Structure
 \item Tove 
  \subitem Customizable software
  \subitem Engaging/Entertaining software
  \subitem Authentic/proper feedback or behavior
\end{itemize}

From the list of requirements of the individual customers, we identified the requirements which were common for all of them, and made a list of requirements which
should be common for all groups in the multi project.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Customizable software
  \subitem Some way to distinguish unique users on the same tablet is required, since people with autism have very different needs and have very different perceptions of the world.
  \subitem Customization should trump feature bloat.
 \item Emphasize visual stimuli
  \subitem Autistic people are visually over stimulated.
 \item Authentic/proper feedback or behavior.
\end{itemize}

These are all requirements set by our customers, however, since this system is dealing with potentially sensitive personal data, it is 
also a requirement that before it can be deployed in a real world situation, that all transmissions are done via a secure connection.
