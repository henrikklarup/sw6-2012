\section{Future Work}

A number of tasks did not get completed in this semester. As this project is properly going to be continued by others students, it is not that big of a problem. 

\subsection{Server syncronization}
One of the main things which did not get completet, due to when the component we needed was available, we did not have more time to implement it, was the syncronization with the server. This can be implemented by using the components which the server group made. This would also make the sync status component in the launcher work.
Another improvement which could be implemented in a future continuation of the project, is the ability to syncronize images on the device, and update the paths dynamically.

\subsection{Unit tests}
Unit testing is an essential part of the project. We did manage to do some unit tests, but for future work more unit tests could be made, and it should be an ongoing process instead of doing them at the end of the semester.
Test to fail, to insure the lib robust DAN!

\subsection{Certificates}
Certificates is one of the core elements in the launcher, and therefore it is also reflected in the Oasis library. A couple of features where not completed for the certificates. The first one, was the possibility to set a time limit on the certificate, so it would have to renew itself after fx. 7 days. This would make the system more secure, but would rely on the users printing out new QR-codes each week, and the Oasis library to generate new QR-codes each week as well.
Another feature which certificates could have made use of, is the possibility to have multiple certificates per user, this would make it possible to have a QR-code for each department a person is in, and thereby only have access to the children in the department in question.
