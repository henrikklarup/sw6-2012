The problem statement is as follows:

\begin{quotation}
How can we ease the daily life for children with ASD and their guardians, while complying with the study regulation? 
\end{quotation}

We are limited by resources and time available, as we are only working on this project for a single semester. 
However, all work done in this multi project will be passed on to the next line of students, which means we can make a full system design and pass on anything we do not have the time or resources for.
This also requires that our work need to be of such quality that it is understandable by students of the same educational level as ourselves.
