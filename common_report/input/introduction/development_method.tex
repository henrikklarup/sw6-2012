\section{Development Method}

As a part of the study regulation we have been required to use the same development method in each individual group. Two methods have been considered, \textit{XP} (eXtreme Programming) \cite{XP}, and Scrum \cite{SCRUM}.

With the knowledge of both XP and Scrum, we decided in the multi project to use Scrum of Scrums, which is the use of Scrum nested in a larger Scrum project \cite{ScrumOfScrums}.

The reason for choosing Scrum of Scrums is that everyone, at all times, will be able to know what the vision of the project is, and how close every group is to achieving their individual goals of the vision.

Another element of the Scrum method is that a close contact with the customers is maintained. This helps keep the product backlog up to date and correctly prioritized. The customers are presented with the vision of the project, as well as showing the latest release when we have meetings with our customers.

We customized Scrum to fit our project. The changes are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The sprint length have been shortened to approximately 7 - 14 half days.
	\item Some degree of pair programming have been introduced.
	\item There is no project owner because this is a learning project.
	\item Everyone is attending the Scrum of Scrums meetings.
	\item The Scrum of Scrums meetings are only held once at sprint planning.
\end{itemize}
