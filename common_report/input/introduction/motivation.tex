\section{Motivation}
As this is a student report written as part of a learning project, we are required to comply with the study regulation. The main areas of focus, as stated in the study regulation, are: multi-project management and quality assurance in the form of requirements analysis, requirements management and testing. The goal is to create a comprehensive software system, across multiple project groups, in order to enhance our competences in analysis, design, implementation and evaluation of software applications in regards to system requirements. \cite{studyreg}

To create a comprehensive system that will be usable in real life scenarios, this project will build on top of a previous project and will also be built with the aim of having other students continue its development later. The project we are building on top of is aimed at creating a touch based tablet system to support children with autism and their guardians in every day scenarios.
